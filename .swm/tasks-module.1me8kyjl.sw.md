title: Tasks Module
---
## 1\. Overview

The Tasks module in Sentry manages asynchronous and scheduled operations, handling background processing that's crucial for the system's performance and scalability. It utilizes Celery, a distributed task queue, to manage and execute these operations.

## 2\. Module Structure

The Tasks module is organized into several sub-modules:

1. Event Processing

2. Notification Tasks

3. Data Cleanup

4. Integration Sync

5. Monitoring Tasks

6. Analytics Tasks

7. Scheduled Maintenance

8. Release Management

### 2.1 Event Processing (sentry/tasks/event_processing.py)

Handles the processing of incoming events.

#### Key Components:

- **process_event**: Processes a single event

- **symbolicate_event**: Adds symbol information to stack traces

- **merge_events**: Merges similar events into groups

#### Key Flows:

1. **Event Ingestion**:

   - Event received

   - Basic validation

   - Symbolication (if needed)

   - Grouping

   - Storage

### 2.2 Notification Tasks (sentry/tasks/notifications.py)

Manages the sending of various notifications.

#### Key Components:

- **send_alert_notification**: Sends notifications for triggered alerts

- **send_digest**: Sends periodic digests of events

#### Key Flows:

1. **Alert Notification**:

   - Alert triggered

   - Notification preferences checked

   - Notification sent via appropriate channels

### 2.3 Data Cleanup (sentry/tasks/cleanup.py)

Handles routine data maintenance tasks.

#### Key Components:

- **cleanup_old_events**: Removes old event data

- **delete_old_file_attachments**: Removes old file attachments

#### Key Flows:

1. **Routine Cleanup**:

   - Scheduled task triggered

   - Old data identified

   - Data removed or archived

### 2.4 Integration Sync (sentry/tasks/integrations.py)

Manages synchronization with external integrations.

#### Key Components:

- **sync_integrations**: Syncs data with external issue trackers

- **update_integration_status**: Updates the status of integrations

#### Key Flows:

1. **Integration Sync**:

   - Sync task triggered

   - Data fetched from external system

   - Sentry data updated

### 2.5 Monitoring Tasks (sentry/tasks/monitoring.py)

Handles Sentry's self-monitoring capabilities.

#### Key Components:

- **check_monitors**: Checks the status of configured monitors

- **trigger_monitor_alert**: Triggers alerts for failed monitors

#### Key Flows:

1. **Monitor Check**:

   - Check task triggered

   - Monitor status evaluated

   - Alert triggered if necessary

### 2.6 Analytics Tasks (sentry/tasks/analytics.py)

Manages the processing and aggregation of analytics data.

#### Key Components:

- **process_analytics_event**: Processes a single analytics event

- **generate_analytics_report**: Generates periodic analytics reports

#### Key Flows:

1. **Analytics Processing**:

   - Analytics event received

   - Event processed and stored

   - Aggregations updated

### 2.7 Scheduled Maintenance (sentry/tasks/maintenance.py)

Handles routine maintenance tasks.

#### Key Components:

- **optimize_database**: Performs database optimizations

- **clear_expired_caches**: Clears expired cache entries

#### Key Flows:

1. **Database Optimization**:

   - Task triggered on schedule

   - Database tables analyzed

   - Optimizations performed

### 2.8 Release Management (sentry/tasks/releases.py)

Manages tasks related to software releases.

#### Key Components:

- **process_new_release**: Processes information for a new release

- **update_release_data**: Updates existing release information

#### Key Flows:

1. **Release Processing**:

   - New release detected

   - Release information processed

   - Associated data updated

## 3\. Interactions Between Sub-modules

The Tasks sub-modules interact to maintain system health and process data:

1. **Event Processing ↔ Notification Tasks**:

   - Processed events may trigger notifications

2. **Integration Sync ↔ Notification Tasks**:

   - Integration updates may trigger notifications

3. **Monitoring Tasks ↔ Notification Tasks**:

   - Failed monitors trigger alert notifications

4. **Analytics Tasks ↔ Event Processing**:

   - Processed events generate analytics data

## 4\. Key Classes

### 4.1 BaseEventProcessor (Event Processing)

```
class BaseEventProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def process(self):
        # Process event data
        pass

    def save(self):
        # Save processed event
        pass
```

### 4.2 NotificationTask (Notification Tasks)

```
class NotificationTask(Task):
    def run(self, notification_type, **kwargs):
        # Send notification based on type
        if notification_type == 'alert':
            self.send_alert(**kwargs)
        elif notification_type == 'digest':
            self.send_digest(**kwargs)

    def send_alert(self, **kwargs):
        # Send alert notification
        pass

    def send_digest(self, **kwargs):
        # Send digest notification
        pass
```

## 5\. Common Patterns and Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: Tasks are designed to be idempotent to handle potential retries

2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging for task failures

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implementation of rate limiting for tasks that interact with external services

4. **Task Prioritization**: Use of Celery task priorities for managing task execution order

5. **Monitoring**: Extensive monitoring and alerting on task queue health and task execution times

## 6\. Celery Configuration

- **Brokers**: Use of Redis or RabbitMQ as message brokers

- **Results Backend**: Configuration of results backend for task result storage

- **Concurrency**: Setting appropriate concurrency levels for different task types

- **Routing**: Task routing to specific queues based on task type

## 7\. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: -

- **Integration Tests**: -

- **Mocking**: -

## 8\. Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a task workflow engine for complex, multi-step tasks

2. Evaluate the use of Celery Canvas for better task chaining and grouping

3. Implement more granular task monitoring and performance optimization

4. Explore options for better task result persistence and querying
