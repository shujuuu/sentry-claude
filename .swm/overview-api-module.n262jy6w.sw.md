---
### Overview:&nbsp;

The API component handles all programmatic interactions with Sentry. It provides a RESTful interface for external systems and the frontend to interact with Sentry's core functionality.

### Key features:

- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on Sentry resources (projects, teams, events, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization for API requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Versioning to ensure backward compatibility

### Example endpoints:

- `/api/0/projects/`: List and create projects

- `/api/0/events/{event_id}/`: Retrieve details of a specific event

### Key Classes:

- APIView

  - Purpose: Base class for all API views

  - Key Methods:

    - `dispatch()`: Handles routing of HTTP methods to appropriate handlers

    - `handle_exception()`: Provides consistent error handling across all API endpoints

- ProjectPermission

  - Purpose: Manages access control for project-related API endpoints

  - Key Methods:

    - `has_permission()`: Checks if a user has the required permissions for a given project

### Key Flows:

- API Request Handling

  1. Request received by Django

  2. Routed to appropriate APIView subclass

  3. Authentication and authorization checks performed

  4. Request data validated

  5. Business logic executed

  6. Response serialized and returned

- Rate Limiting

  1. Request received

  2. Rate limit checked against Redis cache

  3. If limit exceeded, 429 Too Many Requests returned

  4. If within limit, request processed

  5. Rate limit counter updated in Redis
