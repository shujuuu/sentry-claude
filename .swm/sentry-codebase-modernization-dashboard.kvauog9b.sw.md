## High Priority Actions

1. Migrate web interface to Next.js for improved performance and SEO

2. Optimize error ingestion pipeline for higher throughput

3. Standardize SDK implementations across different programming languages

## Recent Changes

- 2023-09-01: Implemented new grouping algorithms for more accurate issue tracking

- 2023-08-15: Upgraded Elasticsearch to version 7.x for improved search capabilities

- 2023-07-30: Introduced new API endpoints for better third-party integrations

## Edge Cases and Risks

- Error Ingestion: Potential data loss during extremely high traffic scenarios

- Search: Performance degradation for organizations with massive amounts of event data

- Notifications: Delivery failures for certain email providers

## Next Steps

1. Conduct a comprehensive performance audit of the error ingestion pipeline

2. Explore serverless architectures for certain microservices

3. Implement a more robust feature flagging system for easier A/B testing
