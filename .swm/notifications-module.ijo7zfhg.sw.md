title: Notifications Module
---
## 1\. Overview

The Notifications module in Sentry is responsible for alerting users about various events and updates within the system. It plays a crucial role in keeping users informed about errors, performance issues, and other important events in their projects.

## 2\. Module Structure

The Notifications module is organized into several key components:

1. Notification Types

2. Delivery Methods

3. Rules Engine

4. User Preferences

5. Throttling and Batching

### 2.1 Notification Types (sentry/notifications/types.py)

Defines different types of notifications that can be sent.

#### Key Components:

- **BaseNotification**: Abstract base class for all notifications

- **ErrorNotification**: Notification for new errors

- **PerformanceNotification**: Notification for performance issues

- **ReleaseNotification**: Notification for new releases

#### Key Flows:

1. **Notification Creation**:

   - Event occurs in Sentry

   - Appropriate notification type instantiated

   - Notification prepared for delivery

### 2.2 Delivery Methods (sentry/notifications/delivery.py)

Handles the actual sending of notifications through various channels.

#### Key Components:

- **DeliveryBackend**: Base class for delivery methods

- **EmailDelivery**: Sends notifications via email

- **SlackDelivery**: Sends notifications to Slack

- **WebhookDelivery**: Sends notifications to custom webhooks

#### Key Flows:

1. **Notification Delivery**:

   - Notification ready for sending

   - Appropriate delivery method selected

   - Notification sent through chosen channel

### 2.3 Rules Engine (sentry/notifications/rules.py)

Determines when and to whom notifications should be sent.

#### Key Components:

- **NotificationRule**: Defines conditions for sending notifications

- **RuleEvaluator**: Evaluates rules against events

#### Key Flows:

1. **Rule Evaluation**:

   - Event occurs

   - Rules evaluated against event

   - Notifications triggered based on matching rules

### 2.4 User Preferences (sentry/notifications/preferences.py)

Manages user-specific notification settings.

#### Key Components:

- **NotificationPreferences**: Stores user notification preferences

- **PreferenceManager**: Manages reading and writing of preferences

#### Key Flows:

1. **Preference Application**:

   - Notification prepared

   - User preferences checked

   - Notification customized or filtered based on preferences

### 2.5 Throttling and Batching (sentry/notifications/throttle.py)

Manages the rate and grouping of notifications to prevent overwhelming users.

#### Key Components:

- **NotificationThrottler**: Controls the rate of notifications

- **NotificationBatcher**: Groups similar notifications together

#### Key Flows:

1. **Notification Processing**:

   - Notifications queued for sending

   - Throttling rules applied

   - Similar notifications batched

   - Processed notifications sent

## 3\. Interactions Between Sub-modules

The Notifications sub-modules work together to provide a comprehensive notification system:

1. **Notification Types ↔ Delivery Methods**:

   - Notification types are sent using appropriate delivery methods

2. **Rules Engine ↔ Notification Types**:

   - Rules determine which notification types are triggered

3. **User Preferences ↔ Delivery Methods**:

   - User preferences influence how and when notifications are delivered

4. **Throttling and Batching ↔ Delivery Methods**:

   - Throttling and batching affect the timing and grouping of notification delivery

## 4\. Key Classes

### 4.1 BaseNotification (Notification Types)

```
class BaseNotification:
    def __init__(self, event, recipient):
        self.event = event
        self.recipient = recipient

    def get_subject(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_content(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_metadata(self):
        return {}
```

### 4.2 NotificationRule (Rules Engine)

```
class NotificationRule:
    def __init__(self, conditions, actions):
        self.conditions = conditions
        self.actions = actions

    def matches(self, event):
        return all(condition.check(event) for condition in self.conditions)

    def execute(self, event):
        if self.matches(event):
            for action in self.actions:
                action.execute(event)
```

## 5\. Common Patterns and Best Practices

1. **Templating**: Use of templating engines for notification content

2. **Localization**: Support for multiple languages in notifications

3. **Fail-safe Mechanisms**: Implement retries and fallbacks for notification delivery

4. **Customization**: Allow deep customization of notification content and delivery

5. **Analytics**: Track notification engagement and effectiveness

## 6\. External Service Integration

- **Email Service**: Integration with email delivery services (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES)

- **Chat Platforms**: Integration with chat platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)

- **Push Notifications**: Support for mobile push notifications

- **Webhooks**: Allow integration with custom notification systems via webhooks

## 7\. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: For individual notification components

- **Integration Tests**: For end-to-end notification workflows

- **User Acceptance Testing**: To ensure notifications are clear and useful

## 8\. Future Improvements

1. Implement machine learning for smart notification prioritization

2. Enhance mobile push notification capabilities

3. Develop more advanced notification customization options

4. Implement interactive notifications for quick actions

## 9\. Related Modules

- **Models**: Notifications interact with data models for user preferences and notification history

- **API**: Notification settings and history may be exposed through the API module

- **Tasks**: Background tasks are often used for notification processing and delivery
